Notes
-------------------------------

1. Two implementations of dot-products are
   provided
	dot_product
	dot_product_unrolled

   The second one is faster than the first one (why?)

2. From the VHDL simulation log, one can examine
   internal system activity during the simulation.
   
   All writes/reads on pipes are logged.



3. For more detail, save the waveform etc..
